//! Resolved X11 paint tier (dmabuf → gpu → shm).
//!
//! [`resolve_and_store`] opens the app's GPU device, so it must run before
//! [`crate::mpv_proxy::start`] repoints `DISPLAY`: NVIDIA's Vulkan ICD does a
//! lazy, one-time global init on first `vkCreateInstance` that includes an
//! internal `XOpenDisplay`. Doing that here keeps the ICD's connection on the
//! real server (not the proxy) and — because it also completes before mpv's VO
//! thread is spawned — wins the loader-scan race that otherwise crashes NVIDIA
//! proprietary on X11 (two threads reading a half-populated ICD dispatch
//! table). The result is stashed in [`RESOLVED`] and drained into the platform
//! state during `lifecycle::init`.
