//! Headless app control-plane thread.
//!
//! A long-lived worker that routes app-level control work off the platform
//! main loop and off CEF's UI thread. Mirrors the playback coordinator's
//! queue + drain idiom (`jfn_playback::coordinator`), but lives in
//! the binary crate because it drives `jfn_cef` + `platform_abi` — layers
//! *above* `playback`, so it can't fold into the coordinator without a
//! dependency cycle.
//!
//! Owns the process-wide lifecycle FSM. Subsystems (X11/Wayland/macOS/Windows
//! platform layers) translate native window/power events into `ManagerMsg`
//! and post them via `jfn_manager_send`; the manager loop folds each message
//! into a single `LifecycleState` and drives the side effects (CEF visibility
//! fan-out, shutdown drain).
//!
//! The `SHUTTING_DOWN` flag (set async-signal-safely by `jfn_shutdown_initiate`)
//! carries shutdown *state* — read synchronously by the TID_UI recreate guards;
//! the queue carries the orchestration *command*. The SIGINT handler can't lock
//! the queue (interrupt context), so it wakes the manager via the signal-safe
//! bridge, and the manager — a normal-context thread — translates that wake into
//! a queued `Shutdown`.
