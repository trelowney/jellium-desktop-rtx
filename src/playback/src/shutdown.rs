//! Process-wide shutdown signal.
//!
//! A single atomic flag (`SHUTTING_DOWN`) gates teardown across the whole
//! process. Shared between SIGINT/SIGTERM, UI close, hotkeys, and CEF
//! window-close paths. `jfn_shutdown_initiate` is idempotent and
//! async-signal-safe up to whatever the registered handler does — the call
//! itself just CAS's the flag and runs the registered handler.
//!
//! A handler registered via `jfn_shutdown_set_handler` runs once on the first
//! call — it runs *inline on the calling thread*, so it MUST only signal or
//! wake (e.g. signal the shutdown manager); it must never block, close a
//! browser, or reenter CEF. The actual teardown is orchestrated off-thread by
//! the manager, which then calls `jfn_shutdown_fanout` to wake every
//! subsystem thread that registered via `jfn_shutdown_register_waker`.
